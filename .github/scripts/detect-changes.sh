#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Decides whether ci.yml's build/test pipeline must run (code=true) or the
# change touches only documentation (code=false). Taken from platform-pgcommon
# (which also records a SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH for its image builds; this library
# builds no image).
#
# Replaces `paths-ignore` on the workflow trigger: a workflow that does not run
# never reports its required checks, so a docs-only PR waited forever on them.
# Now the workflow always runs, and the jobs behind the required checks are
# skipped by `if:` (a skipped job reports success to branch protection).
#
# Documentation = any *.md file, or a *.mmd diagram under docs/architecture/
# (docs.yml checks those with `make docs-check`). NOT documentation: any other
# file under docs/architecture/ (a .go file there would be a package of the
# module), and every file outside those patterns — Go code, SQL migrations,
# YAML, scripts, the Makefile, go.mod.
#
# Every path of the change is judged: the diff runs with --no-renames, so a
# rename or move is listed as a deletion of the old path plus an addition of
# the new one. Renaming pkg/x.go to pkg/x.md, moving code under
# docs/architecture/, or deleting a .go file therefore counts as code (with
# rename detection on, only the new, docs-looking path was listed).
#
# Paths are read NUL-separated (-z: no quoting, spaces and newlines intact)
# and printed sanitised, so a file named `::warning::x` cannot inject a
# workflow command into the log.
#
# Inputs (env): EVENT_NAME, BEFORE (push: previous tip). Needs the checkout's
# history: fetch-depth 0 (push) or ≥ 2 (pull_request: the merge commit and its
# first parent, the base tip). Tested by detect-changes_test.sh
# (`make ci-scripts-test`).
